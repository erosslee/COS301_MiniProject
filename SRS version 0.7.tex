\section{Introduction}
\textbf{(DONE by Zenadia - awaiting approval)}\\
The purpose of this requirements document is to identify and assess the specifications of the project, for the developers; as indicated by the client, the University of Pretoria’s Department of Computer Science. 
This document is to ensure that the requirements, specifications and scope of the project are understood and followed and to ensure that any and all parties involved understand the implications and understand what the final product should be capable of. This documents serves as an official contract and agreement between the developers and the client.

\section{Vision}
\textbf{(DONE by Z\"uhnja - needs to be checked)}\\
The main purpose of this project is that marks can easily be added directly to the university\textquoteright
s database through a user-friendly interface. No in between procedures.   Evaluators will be able to access the system with a mobile approach or via computer while they are assessing.  Students will be able to log into the system and view all of their marks. \\ \\
The client\textquoteright
s main aim with this project is to simplify and increase the efficiency of the marking system.
The project in question is meant to provide the Department of Computer Science with a sustainable and convenient system by which marks may be kept track of, changed and stored in a secure and efficient manner:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Store the marks of students registered for specific modules.
\item Keep track of the marks of registered students.
\item Track any and all changes made to marks at any point in time.
\item Track tutors assigned to courses and assessments.
\item Keep track of individual class/tutorial/practical/test averages as well as overall course averages.
\item Keep track of overall marks for individual students.
\item Update and display mark statistics in the form of graphs.
\item Store information regarding the privileges of lecturers and tutors.
\end{enumerate}This project scope serves as a basis for the project to expand for various similar applications with minimal changes necessary.

\section{Background}
\textbf{(DONE by Z\"uhnja, edited and amended by Zenadia - needs to be checked)}\\
This project is the result of the Department of Computer Science‘s need for their own improved marking system to potentially better the administration of students and their marks, and their decision to utilise the COS 301 course’s learning opportunity for the development of the required marking system; however it is also to prepare the developers for the larger undertaking of a similar task for external benefactors and stakeholders. These, among the aforementioned, have led to the development of this project:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Potential business opportunities.
	\item The potential for work experience and skills development.
	\item The request of the clients to simplify/solve problems they are currently facing.
	\item Potential experience in how project development and business procedures work.
	\item The opportunity to learn how software development integrates with the business environment.
	\item Eliminating a common problems experienced by lecturers and students alike with regards to mark management and administration.
\end{enumerate}
Currently students view their marks for COS modules once they are posted on the CS website.  It is usually listed according to their student numbers; thus students are able to view each other's marks. 
During COS practical evaluations, markers evaluate each student's work and write their marks down on paper. That then has to be passed to someone who has the time to enter the marks into the University's system. In the process of this marking system the marks can easily get lost or be tampered with. \\
The aim of this project is to eliminate these threats. Marks won't have the opportunity to get lost, since they will be added to the system immediately. Students will be able to immediately access their marks once it is added to the system and they won't be able to view any marks that are not their own.

\section{Functional requirements}
\subsection{Introduction}
The function of this project is to design an application interface that would enable a marker to upload the mark of a student, in a practical session, with his/her phone.
\subsection{Scope and Limitations/Exclusions}
\textbf {Use a high-level use case diagram with}\\
\subsubsection{Scope}
\textbf {Phone interface for the marker}

\begin{itemize}
\item Markers should only be able to view students who have registered for the specific practical period the marker is assigned to.
\item On specific markers with specific credentials should be able to log on to the application.
\item Markers can only log onto the application for their’ specified time slot and the application should run a check to provide this.
\item The marker should be able to look up the student being marked on his/her phone with either a student number or a first, last or both the first and last names of the student.
\item The interface should be simplistic and show the rubric and mark layout and have input boxes for the different mark fields.
\item For a change of a mark, the marker must provide a reason in the textbox that is saved for future reference.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{A web interface is also needed for lecturers and students}\\\\
\textbf{Lecturers:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can only view records for courses they are in charge of.
\item Need to be able to view records of marks as well as specific marks.
\item PDF documents for Lecturers should be generated detailing marks and 
descriptions.
\item Graphs of students’ marks should also be generated in the form of normal 
distributions, bar graphs and pie charts.
\item Counts of students should be available, as well as students registered standard 
deviations, averages and medians.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Students:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Students should only be allowed to view their’ own marks and check their progress in the course thus far as well as overall progress with the course.
\item The student should not be able to edit marks.
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Limitations/Exclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item No student should be able to view any mark besides their own.
\item The application should only be programmed for android smart phones.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Required functionality}
\textbf{This application should be:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Accessible on android phones.
\item Scalable and viewable on devices.
\item Secure and information sent and received should be encrypted.
\item Auto log out after a specified time.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{The application:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Should have a database containing all students, lecturers and administrators as well as markers and a root user.
\item The root user should have access to all fields of the database. 
\item Should integrate with the automatic marker Fitchfork to receive specific student marks and be able to add these marks to a students’ mark database.
\item Should auto-complete names and student numbers being entered by markers. 
\item Generate CSV files for viewing and also be able to accept CSV files of marks for input into the database of students marks.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use case prioritization}

\subsubsection{Critical: }
\begin{itemize}
\item The application needs to be functioning on the android platform and should be available on all android phones for android version 2.0 upwards.
\item Marks must be able to be entered and uploaded to the server.
\item Have a web interface for viewing marks for students.
\item have a web interface specific for lecturers.
\item Fitchfork integration.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Important: } 
\begin{itemize}
\item Good to exceptional performance speeds.
\item Encryption of communications.
\item Have a root user with unlimited access to the database and application. (The root user cannot edit audit-able documents)
\item Generated PDF documents with detailed reports.
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Nice-To-Have} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Auto-Complete.
\item Auto log off.
\item Student search via first name and/or surname.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use case/Services contracts}
For each use case/service specify
\\\\
\textbf{Pre-Conditions: }the conditions under which the service may be refused (usually there is an exception associated with each pre-condition).
\\\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions: }the conditions which must hold true after the service has been provided.
\\\\
\textbf{Request and Results Data Structures: }Use class diagrams to specify the data structure requirements for the request and result objects (i.e. the inputs and outputs).
\subsection{Process specifications}
For some of the use cases there may be requirements around the process which needs to be followed. If so, these requirements are typically specified via activity and/or sequence diagrams or
alternatively via state charts.
\subsection{Domain Objects}
Use UML class diagrams to specify the data structure requirements in a technology neutral way. These can ultimately be mapped onto different technologies like ERD diagrams/relational databases, XML schemas, Python/Java/C++/... objects, paper based or UI forms, ... But those are just different technology mappings and this would not be part of the requirements specification.
\section{Open Issues}
Discuss in this section
\begin{itemize}
	\item any aspects of the requirements which still need to be specified,
	\item around which clarification is still required, as well as
	\item any discovered inconsistencies in the requirements.
\end{itemize}
\section{Glossary}
The requirements is to be read, understood and validated by a range of people from very different backgrounds (the client, domain experts/business analysts, the developers, software architects, users, ... ). Use a glossary to explain any terms which some parties may not be familiar with.
