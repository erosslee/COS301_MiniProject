\section{Introduction}
The purpose of this document is to specify the requirements for this project.  Developers will find this useful as the content describes the vision, scope and architectural requirements as specified by the client, Mr. Jan Kroeze, from the University of Pretoria\textquoteright s Department of Computer Science. Also, it will help all parties that are involved to understand the implications and what the final product should be capable of. This document serves as an official contract and agreement between the developers and the client.

\section{Vision}
The main purpose of this project is to:
\begin{itemize}
\item provide the Department of Computer Science with a sustainable and convenient system by which marks may be kept track of, changed and stored in a secure and efficient manner.  
\item allow markers to conveniently access the system in question with their mobile devices. 
\item allow students to view their marks.
\end{itemize}

This project scope serves as a basis for the project to expand for various similar applications with minimal changes necessary.

\section{Background}
Currently students view their marks for COS modules once they are posted
on the CS website. It is usually listed according to their student numbers;
thus students are able to view each other's marks. \\ \\
During COS practical
evaluations, markers evaluate each student's work and write their marks
down on paper. That then has to be passed to someone who has the time to
enter the marks into the University's system. In the process of this marking
system, the marks can easily get lost or be tampered with. \\ \\
The aim of this project is to eliminate these threats. Marks won't have the
opportunity to get lost, since they will be added to the system immediately.
Students will be able to access their marks once it is added to
the system and they won't be able to view any marks that are not their
own.\\ \\
This project is the result of the Department of Computer Science need for their own improved marking system to potentially better the administration of students and their marks, and their decision to utilise the COS 301 courseâ€™s learning opportunity for the development of the required marking system; however it is also to prepare the developers for the larger undertaking of a similar task for external benefactors and stakeholders. These, among the aforementioned, have led to the development of this project:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Potential business opportunities.
	\item The potential for work experience and skills development.
	\item The request of the clients to simplify/solve problems they are currently facing.
	\item Potential experience in how project development and business procedures work.
	\item The opportunity to learn how software development integrates with the business environment.
	\item Eliminating a common problems experienced by lecturers and students alike with regards to mark management and administration.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Scope and Limitations/Exclusions}
\textbf {Use a high-level use case diagram with}\\
\subsubsection{Scope}
\textbf {Phone interface for the marker}

\begin{itemize}
\item Markers should only be able to view students who have registered for the specific practical period the marker is assigned to.
\item On specific markers with specific credentials should be able to log on to the application.
\item Markers can only log onto the application for theirâ€™ specified time slot and the application should run a check to provide this.
\item The marker should be able to look up the student being marked on his/her phone with either a student number or a first, last or both the first and last names of the student.
\item The interface should be simplistic and show the rubric and mark layout and have input boxes for the different mark fields.
\item For a change of a mark, the marker must provide a reason in the textbox that is saved for future reference.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{A web interface is also needed for lecturers and students}\\\\
\textbf{Lecturers:}

\begin{itemize}
\item Can only view records for courses they are in charge of.
\item Lock and unlock the database from being edited.
\item Need to be able to view records of marks as well as specific marks.
\item PDF documents for Lecturers should be generated detailing marks and 
descriptions.
\item Graphs of studentsâ€™ marks should also be generated in the form of normal 
distributions, bar graphs and pie charts.
\item Counts of students should be available, as well as students registered standard 
deviations, averages and medians.
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Students:}
\begin{itemize}
\item Students should only be allowed to view theirâ€™ own marks and check their progress in the course thus far as well as overall progress with the course.
\item The student should not be able to edit marks.
\end{itemize}




\subsubsection{Limitations/Exclusions}
\begin{itemize}
\item No student should be able to view any mark besides their own.

\item The root user should have access to all fields of the database. 
\item Should integrate with the automatic marker Fitchfork to receive specific student marks and be able to add these marks to a studentsâ€™ mark database.
\item Should auto-complete names and student numbers being entered by markers. 
\item Generate CSV files for viewing and be able to accept CSV files of marks for input into the database of students marks.

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Use case prioritization}

\subsubsection{Critical: }

\\\\
\textbf{Post-Conditions: }the conditions which must hold true after the service has been provided.
\\\\
\textbf{Request and Results Data Structures: }Use class diagrams to specify the data structure requirements for the request and result objects (i.e. the inputs and outputs).
\subsection{Process specifications}
For some of the use cases there may be requirements around the process which needs to be followed. If so, these requirements are typically specified via activity and/or sequence diagrams or
alternatively via state charts.
\subsection{Domain Objects}
